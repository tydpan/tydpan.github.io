abstract: "EUS-guided needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (EUS-nCLE) can differentiate high-grade dysplasia/adenocarcinoma (HGD-Ca) in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) but requires manual interpretation. We sought to derive predictive computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to facilitate accurate diagnosis and risk stratification of IPMNs."
