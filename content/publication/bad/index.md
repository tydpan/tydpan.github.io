abstract: "In their first year, the Ohio State University Buckeye AutoDrive team finished in second place in year one of the SAE AutoDrive Challenge II. Sponsored by SAE International and General Motors, Ohio State along with nine other universities are challenged with developing and demonstrating an autonomous vehicle (AV) that can navigate urban driving courses as described by SAE Level 4 automation in this four-year competition. Year one of the competition week was held June 6-12 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and focused on the initial skillset required for designing and developing AVs. During the weeklong competition, the teams were tasked with achieving three objectives with a system integrated into a portable cart. A Traffic Light Challenge was performed where the cart was placed at intersections with various types and locations of traffic lights. The teams were scored on their accuracy of reporting the traffic light status over controller area network (CAN) communication. During the Highway Challenge, the cart was placed at various locations on the highway section of Ann Arborâ€™s M-City. Traffic barrels, cones, signs and static vehicles were placed on the road, and teams were judged on the accuracy of reporting these object locations over CAN communication. And finally, in the Dynamic Obstacle Challenge the carts were placed in three locations and the teams were required to accurately track and report their locations over CAN. The teams were also required to give presentations on the MathWorks Simulation Challenge where they performed Waypoint Following, Collision Avoidance, Traffic Light and Sign Interaction and route planning, waypoint following and requirement traceability, as well as a concept design report and project management report. The Buckeye AutoDrive team is comprised of undergraduate, masters and PhD students from Mechanical and Aerospace (MAE), Electrical and Computer (ECE), Computer Science (CSE) and Industrial Systems Engineering (ISE) and is advised by Research Associate Professor Qadeer Ahmed (MAE), Associate Professor Lisa Fiorentini (ECE) and Assistant Professor Harry Chao (CSE). The Buckeyes also were recognized for outstanding performance across various events throughout the competition, taking home an impressive six awards overall."
